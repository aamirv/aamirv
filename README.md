## Howdy

I'm Aamir Virani (he/him) - I like to work on random ideas and code for fun.  Here are a few things I've done over the past few years.

You can learn more about me at [Aamir Virani's homepage](https://aamirvirani.com].

## Projects

### 713Dreams

713Dreams is a [Houston t-shirt shop](https://713dreams.com) I started on [Shopify](https://shopify.com) so that I could learn how the Shopify ecosystem works and build some tools for Shopify. The designs are custom-made - I came up with them and print them on demand using [Printful](https://printful.com), which as also been cool to see in action.

### CREBake

CREBake is a [Chrome extension for LoopNet](https://crebake.com).  I built it using plain old Javascript, HTML, and CSS.  I was trying to understand how much traffic you can really get from the Chrome extension marketplace vs. having to drive your own traffic.  And along with that, I wanted to see how hard it is to develop an extension and what data you can really get from the browser.

### Contact

The best place to reach me is on [Aamir Virani's Twitter](https://twitter.com/avirani).  Yes, it's annoying.  But this is public enough without giving out email information.
